### GOAL 

> Create a webpage that will utilize an external API to request movie data.
The webpage will be served by a back-end which will have the ability to persist data.

#### Back-end Instructions

- Within this repo you will have noticed a folder entitled `flask-backend-starter-code`.


- The back-end contain several errors,
so you will need to do some debugging to ensure is working correctly.

- The page should have a form that accepts a users query.
- the api uses the [OMDBapi](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
to search for matching movies and then display the results.
 - *Example*: If a user searches for `Star Wars`, a list of every Star Wars movie will be displayed.

- When the user clicks on a search result display detailed information about that movie in a new page.
- *Example*: If a user is viewing a list of every Star Wars movie and clicks on `Star Wars: A New Hope`,
the browser opens a new page with information about that specific movie.

- Users should be able to "favorite" a movie and have it persisted via the provided back-end.

- Provide a link to display favorited movies.

#### Things we are looking for

- Clear, simple code
- Explanatory comments for beginners
- Consistent Naming Conventions
- Valid HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript

#### Deliverables

- Please send us back a link to a git repo with the completed code challenge. 

- Include a README.md file in your repo with a link to your application deployed on Heroku or Digital Ocean.
